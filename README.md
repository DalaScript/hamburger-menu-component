## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Js

### Continued development

am currently focused on advancing my skills in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend side, I am exploring modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

For backend development, I am working with technologies including Express.js, Next.js, Prisma, MySQL, and TypeScript to gain a deeper understanding of server-side logic, APIs, and database management.

My goal is to become a well-rounded developer by continuously learning and applying these tools in real-world projects.
